    Calculates appropriate clusters for data points
    of arbitrary dimension using the spectral clustering
    algorithm, and then displays the results
    graphically, along with a visual representation
    of the constructed similarity graph.


    The Spectral Clustering algorithm makes use of 
    the k-means algorithm, which is implemented in C
    for speed. The Spectral Clustering component is 
    written in Python because it uses `numpy` to 
    find eigenvalues.


    I've written about `matplotlib` integration as well
    as C extensions on this site. I'm not allowed to release
    the full source at this time.

    This is a particle physics simulator. There are several
    different pixel types, each with different properties. 


    The game world features forces, explosions, gravity, as well
    as mechanisms to override these for each individual particle type.
